# Portfolio
My portfolio, made with React(vite), nodemailer and TailwindCSS.

## Functionality
The app allows users to find some of my larger scale projects and get in contact with me through a mailing system using Nodemailer.js.

## Running the app
The backend is deployed on render, and the frontend on Netlify. Find the app [here](https://wilzo-codes.netlify.app/).

## Changes to be made
- Implement some simple animations using CSS and TailwindCSS. ✅
- Automated response mail or modal confirming contact form has been submitted. ✅
- Implement blog page functionality.

## Improving Accessibility and Usability
- My initial designs for my portfolio were meant more for effect and to showcase some skill in design and UX, but were a little unclear, particularly the projects component. After some feedback and redesigning, I made the links to the repos and sites more clear, implemented a more simple and effective layout, and added some animations to spice it up.
- With my target audience being recruiters, engineers and possible collaborators, I wanted to make the landing page less minimalistic, to be more gripping and informative in a shorted time-frame. So I added a link to my Github, restructured the layout and added an animation to showcase my skills.
