# Portfolio
My portfolio, made with React(vite), nodemailer and TailwindCSS.

## Functionality
The app allows users to find some of my larger scale projects and get in contact with me through a mailing system using Nodemailer.js.

## Running the app
The backend is deployed on render, and the frontend on Netlify. Find the app [here](https://wilzo-codes.netlify.app/).

## Changes to be made
- Implement some simple animations using CSS and TailwindCSS.
- Automated response mail or modal confirming contact form has been submitted.
- Implement blog page functionality.
